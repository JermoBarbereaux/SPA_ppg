SPA assignment: The Powerpuff girls

Description:
A SPA project built to display the TV show "Powerpuff girls" with episode details.

Personal notes:
This is my first time making an SPA and one of the few times working with an API. It was a fun and challanging assignment, 
even though I had to figure out quite some techniques since I have not been working with Javascript as of late.

I couldn't figure out how to make a detail page in a SPA, so I opted for a toggle state to show episode detail information.
